abstract: "—Recent research has shown significant success in
the detection of social bots. While there are tools to distinguish
automated bots from regular user accounts, information about
their strategies, biases and influence on their target audience
remains harder to obtain. To uncover such details, e.g., to
understand the role of bots in political campaigns, we address
three questions: Can we describe the behaviour of a bot (when
and how a bot takes actions) by a set of understandable rules?
How can we express bias and influence? Can we extract such
information automatically, from observations of a bot?
In this paper, we present an approach to reverse engineering
the behaviour of Twitter bots to create a visual model explaining
their actions. We use machine learning to infer a set of simple
and general rules governing the behaviour of a bot. We propose
the notion of differential sentiment analysis to provide means
of understanding the behaviour with respect to the topics on its
network in relation to both its sources of information (friends)
and its target audience (followers). Respectively, this provides
insights into their bias and the influence aimed at their target
audience. We evaluate our approach using prototype bots we created and
selected real Twitter bots. The results show that we are successful
in correctly describing the behaviour of the bots and potentially
useful in understanding their impact.
